Well heres what we know so far.

All things in main are carried to other branches. Sorta like inheretancce (yk....).
So just add general things like, Readme , lisence , maybe a help me type thing. Nothing too specfic to any branch.

If you want to add a calculator program, just make a new branch and add it there. That will make it unique to that branch, adding it to main will make it avalible
to every other branch. Dont want that now do we.
